Frameweb is my basic Zend Framework project. Here I will put all the needed steps to build a full featured web project.
At the milestone, it's desired to have:
 - Default project structure
 - Layout and database support
 - Admin module
 - Multi-language support
 - User management
At my blog, you'll find the developer notes and comments about this project. See http://frameweb.blogspot.com
